00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,534
Hey Doctor Carver!

00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:57,709
Ethan, hi.

00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,146
Did you hear our big news?

00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:00,060
No.

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,104
We're engaged.

00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,149
You and Clair?

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,673
Oh, wow! Congratulations.

00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,675
Well, it's all thanks to you, Doctor Carver.

00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,676
If we hadn't participated in your study,

00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:10,287
I probably would have never discovered Clair was the one.

00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:13,116
I'm so happy for you. When's the big day?

00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,726
We haven't set a date yet, but when we do,

00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,119
we hope you can make it.

00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,468
I would be honored.

00:01:17,468 --> 
I'm sorry, I have to run.
